# nlp_project4
This project takes in a number phrase such as "one hundred twenty three" and outputs the number, "123" using machine learning. This project is currently implemented for numbers 0-999

To run, you can create data using create_dataset.py or just use the data I created for the first time. Otherwise, the parser is not set up yet so just run train.py
